# Design in The Browser

In this first exercise, we'll practice iterating on designs directly in the browser.

Instead of using a design tool like Figma, we'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes and Intellisense tooling to rapidly iterate directly in code.

In this first exercise, we'll use the browser (as opposed to a design tool like Figma) to iterate on the design. Tailwind's Intellisense tooling makes working inside vscode surprisingly similar to using a design tool!

## Improving the User Profile screen

We'll use a user profile screen (heavily inspired from the Notes app) as our playground for design iteration.

Let's break down separate aspects of this design we can improve, one by one.

Ready to rock? Let's do this!
