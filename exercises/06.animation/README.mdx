# Animation

- "Enter" animations on page load
- CSS animations
- For advanced animations, libraries like GSAP or Framer Motion are incredible.
- But here we can pull it off with CSS Keyframe animations

- Simple "fade and slide" animations on Text
- Change the direction on extra large screens
- "Roll reveal" animation for the logo tiles

- The cherry on top will be the "logo stagger" effect. The design team will **love** you for that!
