# Logo List

👨‍💼 I know I repeat myself, but... make the list of logos look like the design in Figma 😅

## Wrapping list

🐨 Implement the correct `gap`, `max-width` and alignment on the `ul` element, according to the Figma specs.

💰 Since the tiles seem to be flowing line by line and wrapping, you probably want to look into using [📜 flex-wrap](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-wrap) on that `ul` element.

## Logo tile

🐨 Apply the logo tile styles on the `a` element, based on the Figma design.

👨‍💼 Pay attention to the size, background opacity, border-radius and all!

💰 To center the logo inside the tile, you can use make the `a` tag a `grid`, and used our now best friend [📜 place-items](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/place-items#center) property.
