# Find Inspiration

Early in my front-end dev career, I was often wondering how designers seemed to always know what the newest design trends were, and how they always came up with really cool new ideas.

I quickly found out that the answer was simple: just like many of us devs listen to webdev podcasts and read webdev blogs, designers spend a lot of time browsing design resources.

I was lucky enough to work closely with some very talented designers, and I made sure I watched them "operate", and asked them for good resources.
