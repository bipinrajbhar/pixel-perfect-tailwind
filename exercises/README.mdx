# 📐 Pixel Perfect Figma to Tailwind

👨‍💼 Hello!

My name is Peter the Product Manager. I'm here to help you get oriented and to give you your assignments for the day.

We're going to take a Figma file provided by a design team, and implement it with Tailwind CSS as close to "Pixel Perfect" as possible 💪

Here's the design at different screen sizes:

Throughout this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to:

- Translate Figma “Design Tokens” to the Tailwind config
- Leverage CSS layout tools like Grid and Flexbox to achieve complex designs

We've got plenty to cover, so let's get started!
