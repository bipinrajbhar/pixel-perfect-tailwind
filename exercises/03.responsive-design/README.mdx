# Responsive Design

## Epic Stack Homepage Redesign

In this two-part section, we'll go through the process building this Figma design with Tailwind CSS:

Converting a Figma design to HTML and CSS is a pretty common task a front-end developer may be asked to complete.

Final version (to simplify) on Tailwind Play: https://play.tailwindcss.com/PxMcpCsApf

It's not an overly complex design, but it does expose a few interesting challegnes.

And remember: we're going for a high-fidelity build here.

As "pixel perfect" as possible.

## Figma's Dev Mode

If you're not familiar with [Figma's Dev Mode](https://www.figma.com/dev-mode/), definitely take a look now.

As a developer, you probably want to spend most of your time in Dev Mode when converting a design to code.

- Introduce the Figma design
- Discuss about the design itself, and how to leverage Figma's tools to build it with high fidelity
  - Mouse cursor is your friend!
  - Holding the option key while hovering on things will show you the distance between two elements
  - Dev mode, what you likely want to use at all times

"Thinking in rectangles" — draw mental boxes around things, inspect how the designer built the thing in Figma (containers with padding, ...)

Outside of a custom font, we are not going to customise the Tailwind theme — but here's a great video to learn how you can turn Tailwind CSS into what feels like a bespoke CSS framework for your specific project:
