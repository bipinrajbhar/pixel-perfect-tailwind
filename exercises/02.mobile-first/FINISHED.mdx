# Mobile-First

Our mobile design is implemented!

But did we live up to the "pixel perfect" promise?

Well, if you're game, here's a fun but scary idea:

- Take a screenshot of the Figma design at 100% zoom (you can toggle that with `âŒ˜0 `Ctrl+0`)
- Open up a screenshot overly extension in your browser. `PerfectPixel` does the job quite well.
- Make sure your browser is also at 100% zoom, and set the viewport width to 320px like the Figma artboard.
- Line up the images and see how close you got ðŸ¤˜
