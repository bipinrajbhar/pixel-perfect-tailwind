# Responsive Spacing

👨‍💼 Look at the `sm`, `md` and `lg` screen sizes in the Figma design, paying close attention to the **spacing between and around** elements.

🐨 Implement those breakpoint changes throughout the design.

💰 Make sure you use Figma's [📜 Dev Mode](https://www.figma.com/dev-mode/) and hover over all the things for maximum accuracy!

💰 To help a bit, I've put a little 👀 emoji before every element that needs change.
