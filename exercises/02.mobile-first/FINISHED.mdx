# Mobile-First

👨‍💼 Our mobile design is implemented! But did we live up to the "pixel perfect" promise?

## The brutally honest "screenshot overlay" test

👨‍💼 If you're game, here's a fun but scary idea:

1. Take a screenshot of the Figma design at `100%` zoom (you can toggle that with `⌘0` or `Ctrl+0`)
2. Open up a screenshot overly extension in your browser. [PerfectPixel](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) for Google Chrome does the job quite well.
3. Make sure your browser is also at `100%` zoom, and set the viewport width to `320px` like the Figma artboard.
4. Line up the images and see how close you got 🤘

👨‍💼 Sooo... how did you go?

## Time for a break!

📝 Take some notes on what you've just learned, and quickly fill out the feedback form.

👨‍💼 You know the drill. Time to get away from the screen for a bit, stretch those legs and look at some distant objects to rest those eyes a little. See you after the break!
