# Text Styles

## Layout

🐨 Set a max-width of 'md' on the wrapping div below.

Center the elements horizontally:

- Setup a veritcal flexbox container with 'flex flex-col'
- Align the items horizontally with 'items-center'
- Center the children text elements with 'text-center'

## Font size and spacing

🐨 Apply the correct font size, weight and spacing to the h1.

🐨 Apply the correct text color and decoration to the link.

Don't worry about the hover state for now — we'll take care of these in the `interaction` section.
