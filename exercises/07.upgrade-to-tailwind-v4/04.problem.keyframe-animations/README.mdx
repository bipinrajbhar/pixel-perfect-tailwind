# Keyframe Animations

👨‍💼 Final stop: the keyframe animations. Make the awesome roll-reveal and other animations work once again!

## Defining keyframes

The custom `keyframes` are not defined via CSS variables — they're just regular CSS `keyframes` definitions inside the `@theme`:

```css
@theme {
	@keyframes fade-in {
		from {
			opacity: 0;
		}
		to {
			opacity: 1;
		}
	}
}
```

<callout-warning>
	Heads up, you're probably going to try define a keyframe to: `transform:
	rotate(12deg) scale(0);` When you do that, I noticed that the generated CSS
	output for that frame will be `transform: matrix(0,0,0,0,0,0);`. This breaks
	the rotation animation.
</callout-warning>

<callout-success>
	You can work around that by setting the `scale()` transform to anything else
	than zero. `scale(0.01)` does the trick!

## Defining animations

You can extend `animations` in the Tailwind theme with `--animate-{name}` CSS variables.

## Spring easing from Open Props

In the Tailwind config, we're importing `easing` props from Open Props:

```ts filename="tailwind.config.ts"
import easings from 'open-props/src/easing'
```

Those are used in the `roll-reveal` animation:

```ts filename='tailwind.config.ts'
animation: {
 'roll-reveal': `0.4s roll-reveal ${easings['--ease-spring-2']} backwards`,
}
```

This JS interpolation will clearly not work in CSS. Luckily we can also import the Open Props `easings` from the CSS...

```css filename='src/styles/tailwind.css'
@import 'open-props/easings';
```

... and use the `spring-2` easing with `var(--ease-spring-2)`.

## Time to finish this off!

🐨 Port over the `keyframes` and `animation` custom definitions to the <InlineFile file="src/styles/tailwind.css" /> file.

## One more thing...

👨‍💼 When you've done everything, go ahead and delete the <InlineFile file='tailwind.config.ts' />.

👨‍💼 Yup, get rid of the whole thing. We don't need it.

🦉 That's right — no need to configure the `content` array or anything. Everything just works, with our CSS file as the only entry point.

🦉 How coooo-whoool is this?
