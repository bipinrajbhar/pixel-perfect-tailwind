# Side-By-Side Layout

With the small and subtle spacing and typography adjustments behind us, we're going to tackle the big layout change happening at the XL breakpoint.

🐨 At the xl breakpoint, make the grid have 2 columns.

- The first column's width should be defined by the logo grid (auto).
- The second column should take up the remaining space (1fr).

💰 You can use a `grid-cols-[]` arbitrary value to achieve this!

🐨 Make sure the gap between the columns matches the Figma design.
