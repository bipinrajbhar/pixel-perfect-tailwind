# Grid Class Composition

Whew! That was actually pretty easy 😁

🦉 **Warning**: One thing to keep in mind is that when you start placing items manually in your grid like that, any element that _does not_ have a `grid-colum-start` or `grid-row-start` property will find the first available cell in the flow of the grid, and occupy that!
