# Design in The Browser

This section fits well in a 60-minute block.

Here's the breakdown

| Segment                  | Duration (minutes) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Introduction             | 5                  |
| Container width          | 5                  |
| Typography and spacing   | 10                 |
| Elevation and separation | 10                 |

In this first exercise, we'll practice iterating on designs directly in the browser.

Instead of using a design tool like Figma, we'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes and Intellisense tooling to rapidly iterate directly in code.

In this first exercise, we'll use the browser (as opposed to a design tool like Figma) to iterate on the design. Tailwind's Intellisense tooling makes working inside vscode surprisingly similar to using a design tool!

## Improving the User Profile screen

We'll use a user profile screen (heavily inspired from the Notes app) as our playground for design iteration.

Let's break down separate aspects of this design we can improve, one by one.
