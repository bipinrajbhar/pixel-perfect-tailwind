# Tailwind Config

Nicely done ðŸ¤—

We haven't customised much of Taliwind here â€”Â but hopefully you can imagine how any design can be "translated" into a Tailwind theme.

Actually, here's a great video to learn how you can turn Tailwind CSS into what feels like a bespoke CSS framework for your specific project:

<iframe
	className="mt-80 aspect-video w-full"
	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cZc4Jn5nK3k?si=zgh_pL-NF3xoXWtJ"
	title="YouTube video player"
	frameborder="0"
	allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
	allowfullscreen
></iframe>

Allrighty! Let's keep going.
