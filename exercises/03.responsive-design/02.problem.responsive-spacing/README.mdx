# Responsive Spacing

Look at the SM, MD and LG screen sizes in the Figma design.
Pay close attention to the **spacing between and around elements**.

🐨 Implement those breakpoint changes throughout the design.

💰 Make sure you use Figma's Dev Mode and hover over all the things!
To help a bit, I've put a little 👀 emoji before every element
that needs change.
