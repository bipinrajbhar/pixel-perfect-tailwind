# Logo List

## Flex wrapper

🐨 Turn this 'ul' into a Flex wrapper. It should:

- wrap items (flex-wrap)
- center-align items (justify-content)
- have a level 2 gap between items (gap)
- have a 3xl max-width container

## Logo tile

🐨 Apply the logo tile styles on this 'a' element, based on the Figma design.

Pay attention to the size, background opacity, border-radius and all!

💰 To center the logo inside the tile, you can use: `grid place-items-center`.
