# Roll Reveal

👨‍💼 Time to animate the logo tiles. We wanna go a bit fancy here, to really wow the user as we reveal our art-directed logo grid.

👨‍💼 Make the logo tiles "roll", scale-up and fade in over `0.4` seconds.

## Keyframes definition

🐨 Add one more `keyframes` set in the Tailwind theme. This one should start with...

- a **rotation** of `12` degrees
- a **scale** of `0%`
- an **opacity** of `0%`

...and end with:

- a **rotation** of `0` degrees
- a **scale** of `100%`
- an **opacity** of `100%`

## Custom timing function

🐨 Add a 'roll-reveal' animation to the Tailwind theme. It should use the 'roll-reveal' `keyframes` you just created, and animate once over 0.4 seconds.

👨‍💼 Have some fun with the easing function. There is no right or wrong answer here (well, don't quote me on that when speaking to the designers).

### Cubic-Bézier curves

Instead of basic transition timing functions like `linear` or `ease-in`, uou can use the [`📜 cubic-bezier()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function#using_the_cubic-bezier_function) CSS function to create bespoke [📜 Bézier curve](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Bezier_curve) easings for your animations.

💰 It's very hard to "visualise" what the `cubic-bezier()` function does, but luckily for us, there are some great online tools to help. [cubic-bezier.com](https://cubic-bezier.com) is a fantastic example!

💰 Use any value you want here. If you don't feel inspired, here's a suggestion:

`cubic-bezier(.22,1.28,.54,.99)` — here's [what it looks like](https://cubic-bezier.com/#.22,1.28,.54,.99).

## Animating the logo tiles

🐨 Add the `roll-reveal` animation to the logo tiles.
