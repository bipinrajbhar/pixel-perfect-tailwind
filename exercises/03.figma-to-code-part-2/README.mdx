# Figma to Code (Part 2)

<callout-info>TODO</callout-info>

- Introduce the Figma design
- Discuss about the design itself, and how to leverage Figma's tools to build it with high fidelity

  - Holding the option key while hovering on things will show you the distance between two elements
  - Dev mode, what you likely want to use at all times
