# Tailwind Config

Tailwind has a fantastic default theme — and your can build a surprisingly large number of project without ever deviating at all from those defaults.

In this particular design though, there are a few new design values that land outside of Taliwind's defaults.

- `highlight` color
- heading sizes
- screen sizes
- poppins font
