# Port to Tailwind v4 (alpha)

👨‍💼 Sooooooo... A very **early alpha** version of Tailwind CSS v4 was [announced **yesterday**](https://twitter.com/simonswiss/status/1765483668741480689).

👨‍💼 It's incomplete and not ready to be used in production, but I want you to prepare for it, so you can get excited for what's coming.

🦉 Read the [Tailwind v4 announcement blog post](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha) to get a feel for how alpha it is at this point. As Adam Wathan says it, they're **open-sourcing progress**, not shipping a production-ready version.

## Theme configuration in CSS

The major new feature in Tailwind v4 is the ability to customise the theme directly in CSS, with CSS variables.

The JS Tailwind config still be supported eventually, but right now it doesn't exist in v4, so we **must** port our theme configuration to CSS.

## Tooling update

We'll also need to update some of the tools we use to work with Tailwind CSS v4.

Ready? Let's dive into the future of Tailwind CSS!
