# Text Delay Adjustment

👨‍💼 This is the very last touch. The last coat of paint. The cherry on top of the cherry.

👨‍💼 Now that the logo grid has an awesome stagger — I feel like we need to further delay the `slide-left` on the text content bits, to make it feel really balanced.

👨‍💼 So... on the `xl` screen, increase the animation delays on the logo, `h1` and paragraph.

🐨 Add or increase the 'animation-delay' on elements as follows, at the `xl` breakpoint only:

- `0.5s` on the **logo**
- `0.8s` on the **h1**
- `1s` on the **paragraph**
