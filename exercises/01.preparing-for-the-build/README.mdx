# Preparing for the Build

To make sure our project starts on the right foot, we'll go through a few steps to set up our project.

- **Write unstyled HTML**, so we have a working baseline. A document that makes sense, even if it was completely unstyled.
- **Configure Tailwind**. Tailwind is already installed in our project, but we are going to do some customisations:
- colors
- breakpoints
- typography

Remember: we're going for a high-fidelity build here. We want to be as "pixel perfect" as possible.

And this starts by properly mapping our design tokens to the Tailwind theme.

## Figma's Dev Mode

If you're not familiar with [Figma's Dev Mode](https://www.figma.com/dev-mode/), definitely take a look now.

As a developer, you probably want to spend most of your time in Dev Mode when converting a design to code.

"Thinking in rectangles" â€” draw mental boxes around things, inspect how the designer built the thing in Figma (containers with padding, ...)
