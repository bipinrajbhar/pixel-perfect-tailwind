# Design in The Browser

One of the superpowers of Tailwind CSS is how it enables you to prototype and iterate directly in the browser.

Not only does this make you super productive, but the code you write is also production-ready.

Tailwind makes the easy thing the right thing, and that's an incredibly empowering feeling.

## Iterating on the User Profile screen

In this section, we'll take a user profile screen (heavily inspired from the Notes app) as our playground for design iteration:

![User profile screen](/user-profile-starting-point.png)

Instead of using a design tool like Figma, we'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes and Intellisense tooling to rapidly iterate directly in code.

We'll break down separate aspects of this design we can improve, and action them one by one.

Ready to rock? Let's do this!
