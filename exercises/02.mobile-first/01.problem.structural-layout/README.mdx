# Structural Layout

Before worrying about styling the text and logos, let's scaffold the structural layout of the page.

We will need to wrap our entire markup inside two container divs.

## Full-page container

We need a wrapping div that:

- has at minimum the full screen height (min-h-screen)
- centers its children with a grid (grid place-items-center)

🐨 Add the wrapping div to the markup.

## Layout grid

Inside our container, we need a common parent to both the logo list and the text content. It needs to:

- be a grid (grid) that contains two children (cells)
- have a gap (gap-12)
- handle horizontal and verticall padding (see Figma)
- center its children (place-items-center)

🐨 Add the layout grid.

## Text content container

We need to group the logo, h1 and paragraph elements as a single "grid cell".

With CSS Grid, we could technically skip this wrapper, but one extra div is not going to hurt anyone, nor be the performance bottleneck of our website.

🐨 Wrap the Logo, h1 and paragraph in a common parent div.
